<p>
Good Morning Sir/Madam. Am I Speaking with Mr______? 
</p>
<p>My name is __ , I am the Authorised Verifier calling on behalf of HDFC bank with regards to your product query.</p>
<p>Is it a good time to speak with you..? If yes, proceed; else reschedule the call as per customers preferred time. </p>
<p>Sir/Madam, we would like to inform you, that this call is recorded for our quality assurance and your future reference purposes. </p>

<p><strong><u>HDFC Verifier:</u></strong></p>

<p>Sir/Madam, I have called you to explain the Personal Accidental Plan Features and Benefits. I have understand that you have a need for this plan. I will just go through the plan that you have opted</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Dear Mr. Raj, According to <u> <b>Indian Heart Association </b> </u>50% of Heart attacks occurs under 48 years of age, 10 lacs Indians are diagnosed with Cancer every year and 7 lacs die of cancer every year according to the <u> <b> World Health Organization (WHO) </b></u>.  Due to rise in awareness about these illnesses we have seen an uptake in insurance policies like cancer care or Cardio care, but why only seek protection against couple of illness, there are other chronic illnesses like Lungs, liver , Kidney disorders, stroke , paralysis which also needs to be covered.
</p>

<p>We have a comprehensive health solution –Universal Protection which helps you stay secured financially against 25 critical illness. </p>
<p>
This is a benefit offering in which the entire Sum insured is paid on diagnosis of any of the stated illnesses irrespective of the expense of the treatment. 
</p>
<p>Let us assume someone has taken 20 lakhs cover of critical illness and gets a paralysis attack. The cost of your hospitalization and medication goes around Rs. 5 lakhs. Under this  Critical Illness policy the customer will receive a lump sum amount of Rs. 20 lakhs. This will help the customer and his family to focus on getting better rather than worrying about hospital expenses and follow-up treatment expenses.</p>
<p>This additional amount also help us secure any outstanding loan liability like a personal loan, gold loan or a home loan.</p>

<p>If you do not have Critical Illness cover, your hard earned money might get affected. It might be possible you may need to break your savings. The high cost of treatment can destroy years of savings in just a few months.</p>
<p>Treating a critical illness takes time and money. If you are an earning member and are diagnosed with a major illness, you will have to skip work to get treatment for it. This leads to a big trouble:</p>

<p>
	<ul style="line-height:25px;">
		<li>You lose your monthly income</li>
		<li>Expenses will increase because of frequent visits to the hospital, expensive medical tests and medicines that will be required for complete recovery</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	In this case, a health insurance plan will only reimburse your hospitalisation costs.  A Critical illness not only cover just hospitalisation costs but helps you cover other expenses like doctor consultation fees, cost of medicines etc. In addition to this</p>
	<p>
This product also has 2 additional offerings -20 lacs of Personal Accident. No income proof is required for claiming the benefit. This covers Accidental Death benefit, Permanent total disability and Permanent partial disability along with Child Education Benefit – 10% of SI up to maximum of 50 Thousand payable per child up to a maximum of 3 children </p>
<p>
 Daily hospital cash benefit - All health policies take care of the cost of hospitalisation. However, expenses incurred on, say, food or refreshments or, the money spent by your family while commuting between hospital and home add up to a substantial amount. It is always advisable to have a daily hospital cash allowance. Best part of this benefit is no deductible when you avail daily hospital cash.  You can use the money for regular expenditure which doesn’t get covered in a regular Health policy.
